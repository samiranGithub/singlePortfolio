        There are a number of remarkable things about these lockdown days that are worth 
        photographing now so we can remember them when it is all over.

        Streets empty that are usually busy are remarkable and can evoke the sense of historical 
        pictures from before the invention of the motorcar. Other things that are different at 
        the moment will be queues to get into stores and the lines marked out on the floor to 
        show how far apart we should be.`,

        desc2: `Pretend everything is new and that you haven’t seen it before, and then you 
        will be free to notice the leading lines, the places where one edge meets another in 
        delightful geometric harmony, and how the ordinary things in the kitchen are transformed 
        when the light is on or off.

        The trick here is to look slowly, and then look again. Take the time to look in detail 
        and to look at the same thing from different angles, with different light, long lenses 
        and wide lenses. Then move to the left a bit. You may never feel the need to leave the 
        house again.`,

        strong: `Just because we can't get out and about like we normally would, doesn’t mean we have
        to stop taking pictures. There’s still plenty you can do, provided you're prepared to
        use some imagination. Here are a few ideas to keep you shooting until normal life
        resumes.`,

        italic: `Most photographers find it hard to see interesting pictures in places in which they
        are most familiar. A trip somewhere new seems always exactly what our photography
        needed, as shooting away from home consistently inspires us to new artistic heights.`
